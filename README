sockburn

Sockburn provides a tcp send/recv mechanism which sends large bulky streams of data as rapidly
as possible between two executions of itself. It is very lightweight, portable python2 code
which runs fine with no extra libraries on linux, windows, and freebsd. It is currently
sufficient for its purpose but will eventually be changed into a full select reactor to add
further features (udp, multicast, full duplex, mixed mode, multi-port, etc)

Typical use is to run instances on two separate machines in order to test optimistic wifi
network conditions between the two machines. It can be used to assess issues such as slow
TimeMachine backups, or video streaming issues.

Ex:
On machine A (192.168.1.6) wait to receive:
   python sockburn.py r

On machine B (192.168.1.9) attempt to send to machine A:
   python sockburn.py s --host 192.168.1.6

Both machines will then show achieved bandwidth while attempting to transport ~10GB of data
ctrl-c on either machine will effectively terminate both processes.

Note: Sockburn uses port 6666 by default. --port can be used to change the port. Any firewalls
on either machine or in between will need to allow port 6666 tcp or whichever port you choose.
